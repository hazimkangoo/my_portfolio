# Projects
### Customer Segmentation Analysis

In this project, the focus was on analyzing customer data from a retail store to identify different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. The project involved data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis to identify patterns in the data, and clustering techniques (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) to segment the customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis was presented using data visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps, bar charts) to make it easier to understand. Finally, recommendations were provided based on the analysis for how the retail store can tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement for each customer segment. The skills used in this project include data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, clustering techniques, and data visualization.
